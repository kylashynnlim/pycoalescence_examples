This repository contains examples of the pycoalescence package described [here](https://pycoalescence.readthedocs.io)

The examples provided in the jupyter notebooks are intended to act as boilerplate for 
performing simulations and running basis analyses. We intentionally only describe
the basic features most likely to be relevant to the average user. As such, many more
advanced scenarios that are possible within this package are not described.
